"""Build the corpus from Project Gutenberg's RDF feed.

    python tools/fetch.py            # use a cached archive if present
    python tools/fetch.py --refresh  # re-download the archive

Why the RDF tarball rather than the gutendex API: gutendex serves 32 books per page
with no page_size option, and deep pages take 12 to 20 seconds, so the full 79k
corpus is 2,472 requests and hours of wall clock. The RDF feed is ONE request that
carries the same numbers - verified against gutendex on three books, exact match -
plus the author dates, which the API only exposes per book.

THE KEY FACT ABOUT THE DOWNLOAD FIGURE, verified against Gutenberg's own
documentation rather than assumed: `pgterms:downloads` is "the approximate number of
downloads in the last 30 days (updated daily)". It is NOT cumulative since upload.
That matters twice over:
  - it is a measure of CURRENT readership, so "still read" is literally true, and
  - there is no confound from how long a file has been online, which a cumulative
    count would have had and which would have needed disclosing on the page.
The cost is that a 30-day window is noisy and seasonal (set texts spike in term
time), which is why `data/history.csv` keeps a weekly snapshot.
